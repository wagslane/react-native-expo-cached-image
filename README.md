# react-native-expo-cached-image

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/react-native-expo-cached-image.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/react-native-expo-cached-image)

Cached image component for Expo's managed workflow.

## Deprecation warning

I don't have the time or interest to maintain this little package anymore. Feel free to get some ideas from the code, but I don't recommend installing it directly. Good luck!

## ⚙️ Installation

`yarn add react-native-expo-cached-image`

## 🚀 Quick Start

```javascript
import CachedImage from 'react-native-expo-cached-image';

// In render()
<CachedImage style={styles.imageStyle} source={{ uri: 'https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/QVault-app.png' }}/>

```

The CachedImage component downloads the image to the user's local filesystem using a deterministic hash
of the URI as the path key. If the image is already downloaded, it will be rendered without re-downloading.

### Props

CachedImage is a direct wrapper of the standard [React Native Image](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/image)
and matches it's API. As such, all of the standard props are available as props to CachedImage. Styles are also passed down.

#### ImageBackground

CachedImage can optionally be used as a wrapper of [React Native's ImageBackground](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/imagebackground). To do so, pass in the prop isBackground={true}.

```javascript
import CachedImage from 'react-native-expo-cached-image';

// In render()
<CachedImage style={styles.imageStyle} isBackground={true} source={{ uri: 'https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/QVault-app.png' }}/>

```
